#### [The Massachusetts Schools Project with Tableau](/Schools_Project)
<img src="images/SchoolsProject.jpg?raw=true"/>
For this data visualization project, I explored data for **1861 public schools** in the State of Massachusetts and delved into school performances of more than **950,000 students**. The project helped me unleash the power of data visualization with tableau by creating an interactive dashboard that would help me find some data-driven insights to the Massachusetts Department of Education. The main focuses of this project are:
**Which public schools are in the bottom 10 in graduation percentage?**
**Does the plan to build more public schools increase college attendance?**
**What impact does economic background have on college attendance?**
**Which school districts are the best performing in passing the 4th grade math test?**
