#### [The Massachusetts Schools Project with Tableau](/files/Day 12 - 21 days to data.pdf)
<img src="images/Grads.jpg?raw=true"/>
For this data visualization project, I have explored **1861** public schools in the State of Massachusetts and delve into the performances of more than **950,000** students. The project helped me to unleash the power of data visualization by creating a dynamic dashboard with tableau and delivering data-driven insights to the Massachusetts Department of Education. The  main focuses were:
Which public schools are in the bottom 10 in graduation percentage?
Does the plan to build more public schools increase college attendance?
What impact does economic attendance has on college attendance?
What are the top performing 4th grade math schools in Masachusetts school districts?
